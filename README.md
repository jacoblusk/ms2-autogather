# Maplestory 2 Auto Gather

I was annoyed that auto-gathering required a badge in Maplestory 2, so I created a simple script
to move the window to the foreground and press <kbd>SPACE</kbd>.

The key to toggle it on and off is <kbd>F10</kbd>.

## Getting Started

Just clone the repository and run `main.py`.

```bash
python main.py
```

### Prerequisites

Python 3

### Future

Ideally in the future, it would be nice to make this more general and perhaps have
the program specified using a ComboxBox, and have the toggle key configurable.
